# Segregate all 0's and all 1's in an array

**Problem Statement:**

You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array.

**Example:**

```
Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] 
Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

### Method 1 (Count 0s or 1s)

```
1) Count the number of 0s. Let count be C.
2) Once we have count, we can put C 0s at the beginning and 1s at the remaining n â€“ C positions in array.
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

### Method 2 (Use two indexes to traverse)

```
Maintain two indexes. Initialize first index left as 0 and second index right as n-1.

Do following while left < right
a) Keep incrementing index left while there are 0s at it
b) Keep decrementing index right while there are 1s at it
c) If left < right then exchange arr[left] and arr[right]
```

**Implementation in Java:**

```
class Segregate 
{
    /*Function to put all 0s on left and all 1s on right*/
    void segregate0and1(int arr[], int size) 
    {
        /* Initialize left and right indexes */
        int left = 0, right = size - 1;
 
        while (left < right) 
        {
            /* Increment left index while we see 0 at left */
            while (arr[left] == 0 && left < right)
               left++;
 
            /* Decrement right index while we see 1 at right */
            while (arr[right] == 1 && left < right)
                right--;
 
            /* If left is smaller than right then there is a 1 at left
               and a 0 at right.  Exchange arr[left] and arr[right]*/
            if (left < right) 
            {
                arr[left] = 0;
                arr[right] = 1;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
    }
     
    /* Driver Program to test above functions */
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Segregate seg = new Segregate();
        int arr[] = new int[]{0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1};
        int i, arr_size = arr.length;
 
        seg.segregate0and1(arr, arr_size);
 
        System.out.print("Array after segregation is ");
        for (i = 0; i < 6; i++)
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Array after segregation is 0 0 1 1 1 1
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
