# String Interpolation

This is a fancy name for what is actually a very simple thing: **combining variables and constants inside a string**.

```
var name = "Tim McGraw"
var age = 25
var latitude = 36.166667
    
print("Your name is \(name), your age is \(age), and your latitude is \(latitude)")
```
