# What is Test-driven development (TDD)?

Test-driven development (TDD) is a development technique where you must first write a test case that fails before you write new functional code for business logic.

TDD is being quickly adopted by agile software developers for development of application source code and is even being adopted by Agile DBAs for database development.
