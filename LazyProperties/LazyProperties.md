# Lazy Properties

Lazy stored properties are used for a property whose initial values is not calculated until the first time it is used.  You can declare a lazy stored property by writing the lazy modifier before its declaration. Lazy properties are useful when the initial value for a property is reliant on outside factors whose values are unknown.
