# Hybrid vs Native apps

### Hybrid apps:

**Pros:**

- **The cost** - The cost of developing a hybrid app is lower than a native app. This is one of the biggest pros of hybrid apps. This means you don’t have to create two separate apps for Android and iOS, instead, a single app is used for both platforms.

- **Lower requirements** - The hybrid app has much fewer requirements in comparison with the native app because only one app is developed for all platforms.

- **Single Language and Code Base** - One language can be used on every available platform. This, of course, requires a Ionic/Phonegap wrapper. You don't need to learn SWIFT or Java, to do any development. You need only to understand the basics of the Ionic/Phonegap implementation. You will need to play with above-mentioned languages a bit but you don't need to understand them.

	**NOTE:** The Cost and Time factor only applies if the components we are using are already created and client is ready using the same components without any configuration changes.

**Cons:**

- **User experience** – The user experience of hybrid apps can never be like native apps. And first user experience is very important for apps because a bad experience can drop the potential user and perhaps results in bad reviews.

- **Lack of some native features** – Each specific operating system has some specific features that are only available in native apps.

- **Efficiency** - Hybrid apps are lot slower and less polished than the native apps, so running a high-performance app will be quite frustrating for the end user.

- **Hidden Bug Potential** - Hybrid apps can have hidden bugs which can lead to errors in the future which will be difficult to retrospectively remove.

	**NOTE:** As an example, take Facebook. Their previous app (if you remember) was a cross-platform app. It was slow, non-responsive, would crash all the time and was practically unusable. About a year or so ago, after countless complaints, they released an update with their native app, and suddenly, all those problems disappeared (well, at least most).

### Native apps:

**Pros:**

- **Excellent performance** - As native apps are precisely developed for a specific operational system, it means they are faster and more polished than their hybrid apps.

- **Better User Experience** - Native apps have better user experience design thus making it easy for the users to use both Android and iOS apps. They have some specific features.

- **Easier access to built-in skills** - Native apps can easily access the additional device functionalities, like camera, microphone, calendar, GPS, etc. while hybrid apps can only allow limited access.

- **Have more users** - Native apps can be easily discovered by the users in the App Store because of its better user experience and user interface design. Thus, these apps can easily reach to the potential users.

- **Flexibility** - From a developer’s point of view, native apps provide more flexibility in problem-solving.

- **Provide Access to the Latest Features** - Another advantage in a native app is the ability to access the latest features of an updated operating system.

**Cons:**

- **Money** - The cost of developing and maintaining multiple apps is much higher than developing a single app.

- **More developers** - Native apps require many developers because of multiple languages.
